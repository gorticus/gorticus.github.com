[Hurricane Sandy][L0] hammered the mid-Atlantic region starting October
29, 2012.  It was a terrible storm, and even now, approaching
mid-November, areas hardest hit are still experiencing hardships.

Having dealt with many past BG&amp;E power outages, most recently five
days without power due to the [June 2012 Derecho][L1], I regularly
capture their [outage (bit) map][L3] for my own records.  The derecho
also motivated me to capture Dominion Electric VA's [outage map][L4]
regularly for comparison.  Here are examples for BG&amp;E and Dominion
VA for October 29, 2012 as Sandy made landfall:

</div>

Loops are available [here][L5] for October 29 through November 3, 2012.
The `README.md` contains some description and direct links to the raw
gifs.

Luckily, my area maintained power all through Sandy's attack.  Time for
a [transfer&nbsp;switch][L2], a portable power generator, and a fuel
stock for the next unplanned outage.

Best wishes to those in NY and NJ for relief and restoration of
services.
